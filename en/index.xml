      <description>MicrosoftDudes is live
Jeroen had an idea for a while to do something with a vlog/streaming idea. However, the challenge was to find 2 other &amp;ldquo;dudes&amp;rdquo; who supported this idea and of course also want to participate. Fortunately, Jeroen had found 2 colleagues who were interested in it.
After we talked to our employer SKS Professionals about sponsoring this idea, we got the green light.
After this, we needed a nice name for this idea.</description>
