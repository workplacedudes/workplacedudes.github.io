In our very first show we will of course do a little introduction about ourselves. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about Microsoft exams and certifications.
  Topics that come up are:
 Why certified? Preparing for the exam Online or test center? Cross-exam skills Do&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; Don&amp;rsquo;ts  Since this was the first episode for us, we had to get used to it. So sometimes things do go wrong, but that is a learning process for us.</description>

Jeroen had an idea for a while to do something with a vlog/streaming idea. However, the challenge was to find 2 other &amp;ldquo;dudes&amp;rdquo; who supported this idea and of course also want to participate. Fortunately, Jeroen had found 2 colleagues who were interested in it.
After we talked to our employer SKS Professionals about sponsoring this idea, we got the green light.
After this, we needed a nice name for this idea.</description>
