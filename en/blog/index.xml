Episode 01 has been recorded and can be viewed via our Youtube channel.
  In this episode, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about Microsoft exams. So how do you go about it, what resources do you use and, in our opinion, the best method to prepare. Since this was the first episode for us, we had to get used to it. So sometimes things do go wrong, but that is a learning process for us.</description>

Jeroen had an idea for a while to do something with a vlog/streaming idea. However, the challenge was to find 2 other &amp;ldquo;dudes&amp;rdquo; who supported this idea and of course also want to participate. Fortunately, Jeroen had found 2 colleagues who were interested in it.
After we talked to our employer SKS Professionals about sponsoring this idea, we got the green light.
After this, we needed a nice name for this idea.</description>
